// behavior would be to transfer ownership of an open file from one process to
// another over a unix-domain socket, or to transfer an established network
// connection from a child process back to its parent (likely over stdout).
// A popular example of the latter being the ssh_config(5) directive
// 'ProxyUseFdpass'.
